# Defi Wallet for Raspberry Pi

The official DeFiChain AppImage release of the Defi Wallet for Linux will not work for the Raspberrys. So I have made for myself a compiled version of the Defi Wallet for my Raspberry Pi 4B 4GB with official Raspberry Pi OS (32-Bit). This so called `armv7l` version is different to other Linux distributions as well as different to the Raspberry Pi 64-Bit version (arm8). 

The compiled Raspberry Pi AppImage bases on the DeFiChain original source code. No code was modyfied and was 100% taken from the DeFiChain repository.

You can check for official DeFiChain [releases](https://github.com/DeFiCh/app/releases) for latest downloadable installers for Windows, Mac and Linux.

After download the AppImage, save the file where you want (e.g. /home/user/desktop/), mark the file as executable (right-klick the icon, choose preferences) and run the AppImage - that's all...

## DefiNode

On [DefiNode](https://github.com/DefiNode/DeFiNode) you find a shopping list for the hardware of a Raspberry Pi node as well as a 3D case with DeFiChain logo. A good installation guide of the setup of a Raspberry Pi you can find there as well.
